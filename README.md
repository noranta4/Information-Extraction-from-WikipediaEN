# Information Extraction from English Wikipedia
Information extraction from English Wikipedia. The approach used is the one presented in *Integrating Syntactic and Semantic Analysis into the Open Information Extraction Paradigm. Moro, Navigli (2013)* with some variations due to the different goal.

Third homework of the Natural Language Processing course, prof. Roberto Navigli.

University project â€¢ 2016 - Natural Language Processing - MSc in Computer Science, I year 

The statement of the problem is in `Homework3.pdf`. The source code is is accompanied by a report (`report.pdf`), I strongly suggest you read it to understand the solution code. The Moro & Navigli article can be found [here](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI13/paper/download/6837/7016). 

## Problem definition

We want to extract couples of concepts that are linked by a specific
type of relation (Material, Generalization, Specialization, Part, Time). The corpus is a semi-structured
version of the English Wikipedia, each page corresponds to a xml file organized in a part containing the
raw text already split in sentences (one line per sentence) and a second part with annotations of words
corresponding to concepts in the text, included the hyperlinks.

The extracted triples are then used to generate question-answer pairs.

## Approach
For the extraction of those triples (p1, relation, p2) we follow the approach of Moro and Navigli [2013]
with some variations since we need to label the relations to assign them to one of the five possible classes.
In particular the task is accomplished in two steps, the relation extraction and the filtering of the extracted
relations to the types of relation chosen. The strengths of this approach are the integration of the syntax
in the IE workflow, we are going to use it in both steps, and the similarity measure that combines syntax
and distributional semantics, we are going to use it in the second step. 


## Results
The presented adaptation of the algorithm described in Moro and Navigli [2013] has been proved
powerful. The results are satisfactory, we have extracted all the requested triples from the five chosen
classes with an high precision in most of the cases. We have generated a large number of question-answer
pairs.

See the report for a detailed discussion of the results.
